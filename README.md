This Python script creates a simple web application using Streamlit, a library for building interactive web apps with Python. The app is designed to assist in resume evaluation using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques.

Upon execution, the script loads environment variables using `dotenv` and configures Google Generative AI using an API key obtained from the environment. Two main functions are defined: `get_gemini_response` and `extract_text_from_pdf`. 

`get_gemini_response` utilizes the configured AI model to generate content based on the input text, which in this case is a formatted prompt containing resume text and a job description. 

`extract_text_from_pdf` extracts text from a PDF file, which is intended to represent the uploaded resume.

The Streamlit UI is defined in the `main` function. It displays input fields for pasting a job description and uploading a resume. When the user clicks the "Submit" button, the script extracts text from the uploaded PDF, constructs a prompt combining the resume text and job description, sends it to the AI model for processing, and displays the response in the app.

Overall, this script integrates Streamlit with Google Generative AI to create an interactive tool for resume evaluation, helping users assess resumes against job descriptions.
